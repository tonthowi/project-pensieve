**Tone of Voice**  

### **Guiding Principles Recap**  
- *“Don’t overthink it, Pensieve it out, sleep better.”*  
- *“Brain dump releases hormones similar to taking a shit in the morning.”*  
**Tone**: Casual, irreverent, humorous, and encouraging—like a trusted friend nudging you to unload mental clutter without judgment.

### **Empty Canvas Ghosted Hint**  
**Copy**:  
*“Your brain’s clogged? Tap + to flush it out. 💩”*  
**Why It Works**:  
- Uses the bathroom metaphor directly, aligning with the “brain dump” analogy.  
- Emoji adds playful irreverence.  
- Actionable and stress-free (“flush it out” vs. “add ideas”).  

**Alternative**:  
*“Mental constipation? Tap + to Pensieve it out. 🧠✨”*

### **First-Launch Tooltip (Pointing to +)**  
**Copy**:  
*“Overthinking? Start here. Tap + to brain dump—no toilet paper needed. 🚽”*  
**Why It Works**:  
- Humorously frames idea capture as a biological necessity.  
- Reinforces the app’s core promise (“no toilet paper needed” = no friction).  

**Alternative**:  
*“Pro tip: Dump thoughts here, not in your brain’s Notes app. Tap +!”*

### **Tone Consistency Checklist**  
1. **Casual Language**: Avoid formal terms like “add ideas” → use “dump,” “flush,” “unload.”  
2. **Humorous Analogies**: Compare mental offloading to bodily functions (lighthearted, not crass).  
3. **Encouraging Verbs**: “Start,” “flush,” “release” instead of “create” or “organize.”  
4. **Emojis Sparingly**: Use to amplify tone, not distract (e.g., 💩, 🧠, 🚽).

### **Edge Case Copy**  
#### **Network Error Banner**  
*“Whoops—your brain dump hit a clog. 📵 Reconnect to flush ideas to the cloud.”*  

#### **Storage Limit Warning**  
*“Your Pensieve is overflowing! Delete old dumps or upgrade to a bigger brain… er, storage plan.”*

### **Why This Approach Works**  
- **Memorable**: Users associate Pensieve with effortless, almost *physical* relief.  
- **Reduces Anxiety**: Framing idea capture as a natural process (“flush,” “dump”) removes pressure.  
- **Brand Differentiation**: Stands out from sterile competitors like Notion/Evernote.
