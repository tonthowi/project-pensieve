# Pensieve User Journey Map  
**Core Promise**: *“Offload, organize, and act on ideas without wrestling with complex workflows.”*  

| **Stage**       | **User Motivation**                                                                 | **Actions & Pain Points**                                                                 | **Pensieve Solutions**                                                                 | **Emotional Impact**                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Awareness** | *“I’m tired of losing ideas to slow apps.”* <br> *“My brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs open.”*            | - Seeks tools for quick capture but overwhelmed by fragmented apps. <br> - Frustrated by "10-second load time" delays. | - Marketing highlights **<2s note capture** and **all-in-one workspace**. <br> - Demo video shows instant screenshot-to-mind-map flow. | 😤 → 😮 <br> *“Finally, a tool that gets how my brain works!”*                      |
| **2. Onboarding** | *“I need this to work NOW – no time for tutorials.”* <br> *“Will this actually reduce my mental clutter?”*       | - Hesitates to learn new workflows. <br> - Worries about data sync reliability.           | - **One-click note demo** on first launch. <br> - Auto-sync tutorial with progress bar. <br> - Preloaded “Brain Dump” template. | 😓 → 😌 <br> *“Wait, I’m already using it? No learning curve!”*                     |
| **3. Capture**    | *“I need to write this down before I forget!”* <br> *“Ugh, why do I need 3 apps just to save a screenshot?”*     | - Forgoes ideas due to slow app launches. <br> - Manually stitches screenshots into notes. | - **Global Quick Note** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+N`) launches in <1s. <br> - **In-app screenshot** (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S`) auto-attaches to workspace. | 😫 → 😃 <br> *“I captured 5 ideas in the time it used to take to open one app!”*    |
| **4. Organize**   | *“My notes are a mess – how do I make sense of this?”* <br> *“I can’t connect these random thoughts.”*           | - Manually reorganizes notes for hours. <br> - Struggles to see relationships between ideas. | - **AI mind mapping** auto-generates nodes from notes. <br> - **Drag-and-drop canvas** groups ideas spatially. | 😵 → 🧠 <br> *“This mind map just turned my chaos into a clear plan!”*              |
| **5. Review/Share** | *“Where did I put that note?!”* <br> *“Collaborating with my team feels like herding cats.”*                    | - Digs through folders to find old notes. <br> - Uses Slack/email for feedback, losing context. | - **Search with OCR** finds text in handwritten notes/screenshots. <br> - **Shareable canvas links** (future: real-time collaboration). | 😖 → ✨ <br> *“Found Grandma’s recipe in 2 seconds! Shared the project plan in one click.”* |
