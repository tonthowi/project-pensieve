# MVP Features

---

## 1. **Capture** 
### 1.1 Quick Note (Text)
- **Core Purpose**: Instantly offload ideas, thoughts, or reminders in a low-friction manner.  
- **MVP Implementation**: 
  - A text field immediately accessible upon launching the app (mobile) or visiting the web interface.  
  - Support basic rich text (bold, italic, bullet points) or at least plain text for MVP.  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. User taps a “+” or “New Note” button.  
  2. A simple, distraction-free note field appears.  
  3. User types and presses “Done.”  
  4. Note auto-saves locally or to the cloud (depending on your data strategy).  

### 1.2 Pen Sketch (Simple Sketching Tools)
- **Core Purpose**: Let overthinkers and creatives quickly doodle or visually express ideas without friction.  
- **MVP vs. Long-Term**: 
  - **MVP**: A minimal drawing canvas with a pen tool and an eraser.  
  - **Future**: Multiple brushes, colors, layers, shapes, etc.  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. Tap “Sketch” from the menu.  
  2. Opens a basic canvas with limited tools: pen color choice (maybe just black or a couple of colors) and eraser.  
  3. User draws and taps “Save” → Sketch is stored as an image in the note library.  

### 1.3 Multimedia (Images, Audio)
- **Core Purpose**: Capture a broader range of inputs—especially helpful for “brain dump” or references.  
- **MVP Implementation**:
  - **Images**: Attach or upload images from camera or file.  
  - **Audio**: Simple audio recorder for short voice notes (if feasible early on).  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. Tap “Image” or “Audio Record.”  
  2. Flutter plugin for camera or mic is triggered.  
  3. On “Stop” or “Save,” file is attached and stored.  

### 1.4 Stickers (Optional MVP)
- **Core Purpose**: Add a playful, whimsical element. Encourages creativity and personalization.  
- **MVP Implementation**:
  - A small library of pre-defined stickers (like emojis or fun icons).  
  - Drag-and-drop onto a note or sketch.  
- **Interaction Flow**:
  1. Select a “Sticker” from a palette.  
  2. Tap to place or “drag” it onto the note.  

> **Note**: Given the single-developer constraint, you might initially skip or simplify Stickers. But if you can implement them easily (e.g., via a simple Flutter widget library), it can help maintain Pensieve’s brand identity.

## 2. **Clarify**  
### 2.1 Mini “Cleanup Mode” 
- **Core Purpose**: Once a note is created, offer gentle guidance to label or refine it—but remain low friction.  
- **MVP Implementation**: 
  - **Auto-Suggested Tags**: “Task,” “Idea,” “Worry,” “Project,” or a simple selection of categories.  
  - **Manual Edits**: Let users refine or add custom tags.  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. After saving a note, a pop-up or in-line prompt says “Add a quick label?”  
  2. Suggested tags appear. If user taps one, it’s assigned to the note. Or user can skip.  
  3. Additional user-defined tag input field to allow freeform tags.  

### 2.2 Basic Organization (PARA Lite)
- **Core Purpose**: Gently introduce “Second Brain” organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) without overwhelming the user.  
- **MVP Implementation**: 
  - **Optional**: Let the user pick which “bucket” a note belongs in, or skip entirely.  
  - Keep it minimal—just the four categories or a single default.  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. After capturing a note, user can choose “Project,” “Area,” “Resource,” “Archive,” or skip.  
  2. The note is then grouped accordingly in the home interface.

## 3. **Connect**  
### 3.1 Mind Mapping or Linking Notes (Basic Version)
- **Core Purpose**: Let users see relationships between their ideas without requiring complex flows.  
- **MVP Implementation**:  
  - **Linked Notes**: If the user is editing a note and mentions a keyword that exists in another note, a subtle suggestion or highlight allows them to “Link” them.  
  - A minimal “Connections” view that displays a basic node-link diagram (maybe using a simple existing Flutter library).  
- **Interaction Flow**:  
  1. User opens a note → sees “related notes” based on overlapping tags or keywords.  
  2. If the user chooses, they can link them by tapping “Link This Note.”  
  3. The “Mind Map” or “Connections” tab shows a simple graph with each note as a node.  

### 3.2 AI Suggestions (Future/Advanced)
- **Core Purpose**: Suggest relevant references or ideas automatically.  
- **MVP vs. Long-Term**: 
  - **MVP**: Could be as simple as “similar keywords” matching.  
  - **Future**: Advanced NLP or AI-based suggestions.  

> **Note**: Given resource constraints, you might implement a basic keyword match engine first, then consider more advanced AI features later.

## 4. **Publish Mode**  
### 4.1 Combine or Group Notes
- **Core Purpose**: Let users group related notes, sketches, and references. This fosters the “Create” phase in the 4Cs approach.  
- **MVP Implementation**:  
  - **Collections**: Let the user manually select multiple notes/images/mind maps to combine into a single “board” or “project overview.”  
- **Interaction Flow**:
  1. User selects multiple notes in the main list.  
  2. Taps “Combine” → names the board.  
  3. The new “board” displays these notes in a simple layout.

### 4.2 Export as PDF or Share Link
- **Core Purpose**: Create a tangible output or a shareable artifact.  
- **MVP Implementation**:
  - **PDF Export**: Use a Flutter library (e.g., `pdf` or similar) to generate a basic PDF with text and images.  
  - **Read-Only Link**: If you have a back end, generate a shareable link that displays the combined board in read-only mode.  
- **Interaction Flow**:
  1. User taps “Export” → chooses “PDF” or “Share Link.”  
  2. App renders the PDF or creates a shareable URL.  
  3. The user can share, print, or save locally.

## 5. **Implementation & Technical Considerations**  
### 5.1 Flutter Feasibility
- **Sketching**: A minimal pen/eraser tool can be built with existing Flutter packages (e.g., `flutter_drawing_board` or `signature` library).  
- **Audio Recording**: Flutter has plugins like `flutter_sound` or `audio_recorder`.  
- **PDF Generation**: The `pdf` package in Flutter can handle basic text/images for exports.

### 5.2 Data Storage & Sync
- **MVP**: Local storage or a simple Firebase back end (Firestore) for syncing across devices.  
- **Scaling**: If growth demands it, consider robust cloud solutions or a server-based back end.

### 5.3 User Experience (UX)
- **Low Friction**: Keep UI minimal—one main “Capture” page with quick options, plus a side/drawer menu for “Clarify,” “Connect,” and “Publish” modes.  
- **Playful Brand Identity**: Incorporate whimsical illustrations or color palettes. Possibly add micro-animations when a user “dumps” a note.  
- **Optional Advanced Features**: Keep advanced PKM structures (PARA categories, linking, mind maps) available but not forced.

## 6. **Roadmap for Iterations**  
1. **MVP (Focus on Core Capture & Basic Organization)**  
   - Quick text notes, simple sketch tool, basic image capture.  
   - Minimal tag or category assignment (PARA Lite).  
   - Export (PDF) or shareable link for a group of notes.  
2. **Next Steps**  
   - Improved mind-mapping UI with drag-and-drop linking.  
   - Enhanced search and AI-based note suggestions.  
   - Advanced sketching features (multiple brushes, layers).  
   - Collaboration features (shared boards, real-time editing).

## 7. **Why This MVP Delivers Value**  
1. **Immediate Frictionless Capture**: The heart of Pensieve It! remains intact—fast note-taking in any form (text/sketch/media).  
2. **Optional Organization**: Introducing light PKM structures (like PARA buckets or short labels) without overwhelming users.  
3. **Playful Brand**: Stickers or small animations sustain the whimsical identity and differentiate Pensieve from standard note-taking apps.  
4. **Path to Growth**: The “Connect” and “Publish” features hint at advanced knowledge management and creative output capabilities.  
5. **Simplicity for Solo Development**: Each proposed feature can be relatively contained, making it realistic for a small dev team using Flutter.

### Final Thoughts
This MVP balances quick, frictionless capture (the “brain dump”) with a gentle introduction to deeper PKM (PARA, 4Cs). Focusing on minimal but delightful implementations of note-taking, sketching, and simple connectivity (tags + minimal mind map) will keep development complexity in check. You can then iterate on more advanced features—like robust AI suggestions, deeper mind mapping, or multi-layer sketches—once the core user experience is validated.

If you have further questions or want to refine any specific feature, let me know, and I can propose more detailed user flows or technical implementation details.
