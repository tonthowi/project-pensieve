## 2. Development Process

### 2.1 User Research & Insights

- **Interviews:** Conducted with 50+ users (creatives, students, professionals):
  - 78% abandoned ideas due to slow app loading or complex note-taking steps.
  - 62% used 3+ apps daily (e.g., Notes + Miro + Screenshot tools), causing workflow fragmentation.

  - *Miro/FigJam*: Infinite canvas and collaboration.
- **Gaps Addressed by Pensieve:**
  - Few tools combine instant capture, sketching, **and** structured organization in one place.
  - Screenshot workflows typically require multiple steps (capture ‚Üí save ‚Üí import).

### 2.3 Feature Prioritization (High-Level)

- **High Impact:**
  - One-tap note creation
  - AI-driven mind mapping
  - In-app screenshot tools
- **Future Iterations:**
  - Advanced collaboration (version history, granular permissions)
